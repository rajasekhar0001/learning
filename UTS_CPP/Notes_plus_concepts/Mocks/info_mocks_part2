Using Google Mock Part-2:

1) Mocking without deriving from a class:

	Mock classes can be used without deriving from the Original class.

2) Invoking Original and Other Implementations:
	Use namespace -> ::testing::Invoke	

	 If we call mocked method, it will not be called actually. TRy by placing some printf()
	--> To call original imeplementation 
	EXPECT_CALL(mdb, fun()).Times(1)
	.WillOnce(Invoke(&obj , &funcion_name);	

	// Inplace of function_name in Invoke(), some other function can be places which can be any, that will be called. Try with function with
           some print statements.

3) Setting DEfault actions:
	-> Using nmaespace -> ::testing::DoDefault  [ using EXPECT_CALL with ON_CALL ]

4) Performing multiple actions:
	
	.WillOnce(DoAll(Invoke(&obj, &fun_name), Invoke(&obj, &fun_name));  -> Only last Invoke should return not the eother
