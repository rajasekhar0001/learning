===> Moore's Voting ALgorithm
    -> Moore's Voting Algorithm is an efficient algorithm used to find the majority element in an array, which is the element that      appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, where n is the size of the array. It operates in O(n) time complexity and requires O(1) space, making it one of the most optimal solutions for this problem.

Approach: 
    Initialize 2 variables:
        Count –  for tracking the count of element
        Element – for which element we are counting
    Traverse through the given array.
        If Count is 0 then store the current element of the array as Element.
        If the current element and Element are the same increase the Count by 1.
        If they are different decrease the Count by 1.
    The integer present in Element should be the result we are expecting, will traverse the array again and will count the occurances of Element, if occurances more than (n/2), that will be the majority element.
