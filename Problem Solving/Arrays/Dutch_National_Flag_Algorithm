==>  Dutch National Flag Algorithm (DNF Algorithm)

    -> is a popular algorithm used to sort an array containing 3 distinct values.
    -> The main idea is to partition the array into 3 sections
    Assueme pivot as 1
    --> One section containing the values smaller than the pivot value
    --> One section containing the values equal to the pivot value
    --> One section containing the values greater than the pivot

Ex: To sort an array which consists 3 distinct value 0, 1, 2  
3 pointer approach: low, mid, high. And 3 main rules as below

-> low is pointing to 0;
-> mid is pointing to 0;
-> high is pointing to last element (n-1)

if (a[mid] == 0) -> swap(a[mid], a[low]); low++; mid++;

else if (a[mid] == 1) -> mid++;

else
    swap(a[mid], a[high]); high--; // Don't increment mid, because the swapped element needs to be re-examined
