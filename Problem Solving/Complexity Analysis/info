Guide to Big O Notation & Complexity Analysis for Algorithms:

Below are the Complexity classes:

    1) Constant - O(1)
    2) Logarithmic - O(log(n))
    3) Linear - O(n)
    4) Loglinear/ Linearithmmic - O(n* log(n))
        Bigger that O(n) but smaller than O(n^2)

    5) Polynomial - O(n^c), where c is some constant.       ==> Ex: O(n^2), O(n^3), etc. 
    6) Exponential - O(c^n), where c is some constant.   ==> Ex: O(2^n), etc.
        --> In case of recursion, it can be observed max.
    7) Factorial - O(n!)
