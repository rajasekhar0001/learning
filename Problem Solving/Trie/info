Problem Statement: Implement a Trie Data Structure which supports the following three operations:

Search (word): To check if the string `word` is present in the Trie or not.
Insert (word): To insert a string `word` in the Trie.
Start With(word): To check if there is a string that has the prefix `word`.

==> Trie is a data structure that is like a tree data structure in its organisation. It consists of nodes that store letters or alphabets of words, which can be added, retrieved, and deleted from it in a very efficient way.

In other words, Trie is an information retrieval data structure, which can beat naive data structures like Hashmap, Tree, etc in the time complexity of its operations.

Real time use: often used for autocomplete, spell checking, or prefix-based searching.
