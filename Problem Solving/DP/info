Dynamic Programming:
-> A type of programming, which stores all the answers to the sub problems, which are going
to be used later to find the main solution

Types:
1) Tabulization -> Bottom Up approch (Using tabulization, instead of recursion)
2) Memoization  -> Top Down approach  (Using recursion)


-> In some problems, In recursion, instead of solving the same sub problem again if it comes
   we will be storing that in some map or table (which is memoization)

=> Memoization:
    In this case we will be using recursion and array/map/table to store the sub problems solution
    In solving, if the same sub problem comes, intead of re solving using the store answer.
-> Tabulization:
    without using recursion, using Tabulization

-> if possibe, trying to reduce the space complexity without using tabulization and recursion
