Strongly connected components:

-> Can be thought of as a self-contained cycles within a directed graph where every vertex in the given cycle can reach
   every other vertex in the same cycle.
   

-> Can be solved using two algorithms
   1) Kosaraju's algorithm
   2) Tarjan's algorithm


Tarjan's vs Kosaraju's â€“ Basic Differences
   Tarjan's algorithm uses only one DFS.
   Kosaraju's algorithm uses two DFS passes.

   Tarjan finds SCCs during the DFS.
   Kosaraju finds SCCs after reversing the graph.

   Tarjan doesn't modify the graph.
   Kosaraju needs to reverse all edges.

   Tarjan is slightly harder to understand at first, but more efficient in terms of space and steps.
   Kosaraju is easier to code and understand because it splits the work into two clear parts.

   Both find the same result (SCCs) and run in O(V + E) time.
