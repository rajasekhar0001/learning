The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in computer science and optimization.

It asks:
"Given a list of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city 
 exactly once and returns to the starting city?"

ðŸ“ˆ Why is TSP Hard?
    For n cities, there are (nâ€¯â€“â€¯1)! possible routes.

    The number of possible paths grows very fast as the number of cities increases.

    It's an NP-hard problem â€” there's no known efficient algorithm that works for all sizes.

ðŸ§® Solutions
    Brute force: Try all permutations â†’ takes too long for large n.

    Dynamic Programming: Like Held-Karp Algorithm â†’ works for ~20â€“25 cities.

    Approximation algorithms: Give near-optimal solutions faster.

    Heuristics / AI techniques: Like genetic algorithms, ant colony, simulated annealing.
