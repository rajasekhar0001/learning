🔄 What is an Eulerian Path?
    An Eulerian Path is a path in a graph that:

    Visits every edge exactly once, and

    Can start and end at different vertices.

🔁 What is an Eulerian Circuit?
    An Eulerian Circuit (or Cycle) is a special case of an Eulerian Path where:

    It starts and ends at the same vertex, and

    Still visits every edge exactly once.

✅ Conditions to Exist (in Undirected Graphs)
    Eulerian Circuit exists if:
        All vertices have even degree, and

        The graph is connected (except isolated vertices).
    
    [Isolated vertices: means component with singe node which are not connected to any other nodes]

    Eulerian Path exists if:
        Exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree, and

        The graph is connected.

🌐 Directed Graph Version
    Eulerian Circuit (directed):
        For every vertex: in-degree = out-degree

        Graph is strongly connected

    Eulerian Path (directed):
        Exactly one vertex with (out − in = 1) → start node

        Exactly one vertex with (in − out = 1) → end node

        All other vertices: in-degree = out-degree
    
Note: if a graph has an Eulerian circuit, it definitely has an Eulerian path too.


note: CHoosing wrong start node will not give answer
