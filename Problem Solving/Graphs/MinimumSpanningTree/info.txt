Minimum Spanning Tree:

SPanning Tree: A tree can be having multiple spanning trees
    Def: A tree with N nodes and N-1 edges, and all nodes are reachable from each other.

Minimum Spanning Tree: A tree can have multiple Spanning Trees, but Minimum Spanning Tree is the Spanning Tree with Minimum sum of 
                   edge weights among all the possible Spanning Trees of that Tree.


To find MST, we have multple algorithms
1) Prim's algorithms
2) Kruskal's algorithms  -> In order to understand, Disjoint set need to be understood
