Bellman ford algorithm: helps
                1) to find shortest path 
                2) To find negative cycles
                3) Applicable for DG (Directed Graph)
        In case of Undirected graph, need to create directed graph from it

Drawbacks with Dijkstra:
    1) Limited to Graphs with positive edges
    2) In case of negative cycles, algorithm will give TLE (keeps searching for shortest path)


Bellman ford algorithm steps:
-> In a graph of N nodes, in worst case, you will take N-1 edges to reach from the first to last, thereby we iterate N-1 iterations.
-> In each iteration, will traverse all the edges and check for condition (which is relaxation)
    Ex: (u, v, wt)  -> to travel from u to v
    if(dist[u] != 1e8 && dist[u] + wt < dist[v]) {
        dist[v] = dist[u] + wt;
    }

-> To check whether negative cycle exist or not, will do Nth relaxation

Negative Cycle: A cycle is called a negative cycle if the sum of all its weights becomes negative. The following illustration is an example of a negative cycle:

--> Negative cycles can be counted in the Nth relaxation
    if there is possibility of relaxation for any node, there negative cycle exist
    in that case, use some visited array, use BFS or DFS to find Negative cycles count
    --> visited array helps, not to visit any node twice


Code:
vector<int> bellmanFord(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int src) {
    vector<int> dist(V, 1e8);
    
    dist[src] = 0; // Update min distance to reach source node
    
    // Do N-1 iterations (or relaxations)
    for(int iter=0;iter < V - 1;iter++) {
        // Iterate all edges in every relaxation
        for(auto edge : edges) {
            if(dist[edge[0]] != 1e8 && dist[edge[0]] + edge[2] < dist[edge[1]]) {
                dist[edge[1]] = dist[edge[0]] + edge[2];
            }
        }
    }
    
    // N-th relaxation to check for the existance of negative cycles
    for(auto edge : edges) {
        if(dist[edge[0]] != 1e8 && dist[edge[0]] + edge[2] < dist[edge[1]]) {
            // Apply DFS or BFS and use visited array, to count Negative cycles
            return {-1};
        }
    }
    
    return dist;
    
}
