==> Kadane's algorithm, which is used to find the maximum subarray sum and the subarray with maximum sum

The intuition of the algorithm is not to consider the subarray as a part of the answer if its sum is less than 0. A subarray with a sum less than 0 will always reduce our answer and so this type of subarray cannot be a part of the subarray with maximum sum.

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

-> We will run a loop(say i) to iterate the given array.
-> Now, while iterating we will add the elements to the sum variable and consider the maximum one.
-> If at any point the sum becomes negative we will set the sum to 0 as we are not going to consider it as a part of our answer.
