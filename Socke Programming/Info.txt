Socket programming in CPP:
   refers to the method of communication between two sockets on the network using C++
   Programming.

--> We use socket API to create a connection between the two programs running on the network, one of which 
    receives the data by listening to the particular address port, and the other sends the data. Socket programming
    allows bidirectional programming between the nodes.

What are sockets?
   A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
--------------------------------------------
==>> Types of sockets
1. Stream socket (connection oriented like TCP)
2. Datagram sockets (connection less like UDP)

---------------------------------------------
Note:
-->> Endian ness should be considered while doing socket programming
-->> Host system may be using Little Endian or Big Endian architectures 
-->> Just like host Network can also using different Endian architectures
 Ex: Stream Socket (TCP/ IP) based network uses Big Endian Architecture (i.e, Most Significant Byte (MSB) at the Lower Memory address.

Blocking Socket: (Refer fig: sp_001)
-> If any client request something to the Server(server socket), client needs to wait until server sends response to client
    ...> Server may be taking time to process the request.

   ===>>> Until client gets response, all other threads/clients has to wait
             That's why in most of the cases if we are using Blocking socket, we will be using multi threaded socket, so if any one thread is waiting
             Other threads can fulfill their requirements (other threads will continue the work)
Ex: In most of the cases, we will be using one thread is for receiving the requests and other thread is to serve the requests

--------------------------------or-------------------------------
	A socket is in blocking mode when an I/O call waits for an event to complete. If the blocking mode is set for a socket, the calling program 
is suspended until the expected event completes.

Note: The default mode of the socket is Blocking ( no need to write code to block again)
    -> To use non blocking socket we need to write code for that using some system call after socket() call and bind() call
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non Blocking Socket: (learn in future)

EX : long val = 0;
     ioctlsocket(socket_descriptor, FIONBIO, &val); // socket_descriptor is return value of socket system call and FIONBIO is macro
     -> val = 0 // for blocking socket
     -> val = 1 // for non- blocking socket
