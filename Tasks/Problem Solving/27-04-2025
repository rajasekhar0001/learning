Find the centre of the tree
   --> using 2 approaches
   1) Removing the leaf nodes, till 1 or 2 nodes remains that could be the centre
   2) FInd the longest path or diameter of the tree (will do this twice using DFS or BFS
   to find longest path from A -> B and B -> A), get the middle nodes 1 or 2.
