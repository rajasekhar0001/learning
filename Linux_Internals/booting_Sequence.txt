Linux Booting Sequence:

Booting of an OS: Loading OS into RAM ( Loading of OS from secondary memory to Primary memory(RAM) )
-> OS is installed in Hard disk or ROM
-> the program which ever is executing in the RAM only

Note: Even when we execute a program it will be loaded into RAM then gets executed



When we turn on system, sequence of steps will be followed to load OS

1. System start up:  
-> The first software which will be loaded is BIOS (Basic Input Output System)
     -> run basic test on hardware, Check enough space is there in RAM, Initialize address to the Hardwares
2. Stage-1 boot loader:  MBR (Master Boot Record)
   -> Primary task of MBR is to load the stage2 boot loader
   -> MBR has information about the disk partitions
3. Stage-2 boot loader: Which will load the OS  (OS loader)
       -> LILO - LInux LOader    
       -> GRUB - GRand Unified Bootloader
     ==> OS loaders, which will load OS kernel into the RAM
4. Kernel: Linux kernel is loaded    (/boot)
5. User Aplication:  init -> deamon process, which will do some maintenance task  ( deep in processes chapter)

Q1). WHere BIOS is stored?
     -> It is stored in a separate chip (near mother board will be having BIOS chip or CMOS chip), BIOS program
        is stored
Q2). WHere stage-1 boot loader is stored?
     -> Stored in the entry point of the Hard disk, entry point is called as "Sector 0"
Q3) stage-2 boot loader is stored in hard disk in the boot directory
     ->  /boot/Vmlinuz)

===>> Once OS loaded into the RAM, it will be divided into 2 parts
    1) OS space  (Kernel space)
    2) User space (Application running space) 


===>>> Once init is executed what happens ?
   -> 

         main()
   Boot   ->      Initialization   ->      Operating modules [ Supervisor mode ] ->
