-> Maps are designed in such a way they, each element is a combination of key- value pair
-> ordered map(map) -> Is by default sorted based on key (uses)
-> unordered_map(unordered_map) -> folows insertion order (uses hashing internally)

-> To sort map, based on value, used vectors
-> sort() can't be used with map
