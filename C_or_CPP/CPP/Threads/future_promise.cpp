/*
Promise and Future:

-> These are like signals between threads, ex: if one thread expects something that 
   other thread has to do and waiting for response.

Ex:

*/

/**
 * we will learn about how std::promise and std::future and how they work together to synchronise threads.
 
 * Basically std::promise is sent to the called thread and once the value is ready we set that value in 
   promise object, now at calling thread side we get that value using std::future object which was created 
   using std::promise object before sending it to the called thread. And this is how we receive value 
   from one thread to another in synchronisation.
*/

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Why future and promise exist
        Mutexes / locks / condition variables â†’ help with shared state synchronization.
        But sometimes you donâ€™t want to share state â€” you just want to pass a result from one thread to another safely.
        Thatâ€™s where std::future and std::promise come in:

        std::promise â†’ a thread sets a value (or exception).
        std::future â†’ another thread retrieves that value, blocking until itâ€™s ready.

        They are essentially safe communication channels between threads.

 *  âœ… Summary
        Condition variable version: Verbose, lower-level, flexible.
        Promise/Future version: Cleaner, less code, automatic synchronization.
        Async version: Easiest â€” just fire and forget, wait for result.
