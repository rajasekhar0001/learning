      otherwise returns false
   -> if try_lock() not able to lock mutex. then it does not get blocked that's why it is called 
      non-blocking
   -> If try_lock() is called again by the same thread which owns the mutex, the behaviour is undefined
      It is a dead lock situation with undefined behaviour.  ( look for recursive_mutex() in this case)

/*
==>> std::try_lock() -> global function (try to lock)
   -> Used to lock multiple mutexes at once

 Syntax:
    std::try_lock(mtx1, mtx2, ..., mtx_n);
  ->> returns -1 if all mutexes acquires lock
  ->> returns 0 if any mutex fail to acquire lock, and all other mutexes also releases lock (unlock)
  --> Even if any exception occurs during locking, unlocks whatever acquired, throws exception
  --> If it fails to lock all, it unlocks any it did acquire, and returns the index of the mutex it couldnâ€™t lock, else returns -1.

  std::try_lock(m1, m2, ...) // helps to avoid deadlock, in case of multiple threads require same set of multple mutex locks.

Note: 1. try_lock()  tries to lock, it won't wait there until lock acquires, it will do next processes not just like lock()
      2. lock() waits until lock acquires
