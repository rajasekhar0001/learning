What Is SLEEP :
0. “I’m done with my time-slice, and please don’t give me another one for at least n milliseconds.”  
   The OS doesn’t even try to schedule the sleeping thread until requested time has passed.
1. It will keep the lock and sleep.
2. Sleep is directly to thread, it is a thread function.

What Is WAIT :
0. “I’m done with my time-slice. Don’t give me another time-slice until someone calls notify().” 
   As with sleep(), the OS won’t even try to schedule your task unless someone calls notify()
   (or one of a few other wakeup scenarios occurs).
1. It releases the lock and wait.
2. Wait is on condition variable, it is like there is a condition variable in a thread and wait   
    is applied to that CV but it ends up putting thread in waiting state.

Note: Both will not be using the CPU while waiting or sleeping
